# Satisfactory Game mechanics summary

Satisfactory is a first-person open-world factory building simulation game. The core gameplay revolves around automation, resource management, and expansion on an alien planet.

## Core Loop:

- Gather Resources: Players manually extract or automate the mining of raw resources (ores like Iron, Copper, Bauxite, Coal, Sulfur, and Limestone, as well as liquids like Water and Oil, and organic matter).
- Process Resources: Raw resources are processed into more complex materials and parts using various machines (Smelters, Constructors, Assemblers, Manufacturers). This involves crafting recipes with specific input requirements and output products.
- Build and Expand the Factory: Players construct buildings, lay down conveyor belts to transport items between machines, and set up power grids to fuel their operations.
- Research and Unlock: Progress is gated by a progression system where players research new technologies and blueprints through the M.A.M. (Molecular Analysis Machine) and Space Elevator. This unlocks new buildings, recipes, and tools.
- Automate and Optimize: The ultimate goal is to create increasingly complex and efficient production lines that automatically produce goods without manual intervention. This involves optimizing layouts, conveyor belt throughput, and power usage.


## Key Mechanics:

- Production Chains: Resources flow through a series of machines to create higher-tier items. Understanding the dependencies and ratios between different production steps is crucial.
- Logistics (Conveyor Belts and Pipelines): Efficiently transporting items and fluids across the factory is a significant challenge. Conveyor belts have varying speeds, and pipelines are used for liquids and gases.
- Power Generation and Distribution: Buildings require power, generated from various sources like biomass, coal, fuel, or nuclear power. Players need to manage their power grid and ensure sufficient power generation.
- Exploration and Resource Discovery: The open world contains different biomes with varying resource node locations and densities. Exploring to find new resources and optimal building sites is part of the gameplay.
- Building System: A flexible building system allows players to construct and arrange buildings and infrastructure in a 3D space.
- Recipe Management: Each processing machine has a set of recipes it can produce, each requiring specific inputs and producing specific outputs. Players need to manage which recipes are active in each machine.
- Tier Progression: Unlocking new tiers through the Space Elevator grants access to more advanced buildings, resources, and production capabilities.
